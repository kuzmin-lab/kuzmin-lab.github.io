  description: "A central question in evolution has remained the persistence of duplicated genes over million years of evolution. We are using trigenic synthetic genetic array methodology to investigate the functional redundancy and divergence of duplicated genes in alternative growth conditions, such as metabolic conditions. This approach will enable us to understand selective pressures on duplicated genes as a result of changes to the metabolic milieu at the time of the occurrence of whole genome duplication."
