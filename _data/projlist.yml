  description: "A central question in evolution has remained the persistence of duplicated genes over millions of years. We will use trigenic synthetic genetic array methodology in yeast to investigate the functional redundancy and divergence of duplicated genes in alternative growth conditions using complex genetic interactions. This approach will enable us to understand selective pressures on duplicated genes as a result of changes to the metabolic milieu at the time of the occurrence of whole genome duplication."

  description: "An outstanding question in the field, is the extent of genetic interaction network conservation. We will use trigenic synthetic genetic array methodology in yeast to interrogate complex genetic interaction networks. This approach will enable us to determine whether genetic network rewiring involving complex genetic interactions can expand the level of conservation of genetic interactions between evolutionary distant organisms."
