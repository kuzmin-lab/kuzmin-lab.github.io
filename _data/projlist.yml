  description: "A central question in evolution has remained the persistence of duplicated genes over million years. We are using trigenic synthetic genetic array methodology in yeast to investigate the functional redundancy and divergence of duplicated genes in alternative growth conditions using complex genetic interactions. This approach will enable us to understand selective pressures on duplicated genes as a result of changes to the metabolic milieu at the time of the occurrence of whole genome duplication."
